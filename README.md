# Major Haemorrhage Protocol

Major haemorrhage is defined as blood loss requiring ≥4 units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) in the past hour, or blood loss with an anticipated need for ≥4 units RBC in the next hour. During treatment of major haemorrahge, 3 main blood componenets need to be administered: RBC, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Platelets. The majority of evidence from clinical literature indicates that transfusion of these 3 blood components, specifically in a 1:1:1 ratio, maximizes survival outcomes for patients. Hospitals will generally institute their own major haemorrhage protocols to ensure the appropriate blood components are administered such that this ideal ratio is met.

Data has been collected for major haemorrhage cases from 2017 - present. This data includes Date, Age, Gender, Reason for protocol activation, Time of activation, 30 Day survival as well as the number of units of each blood component that was ordered, transfused and wasted. The objectives of this project were to:

- Assess whether the transfusion ratios have been improving from 2017
- Assess whether any change in transfusion ratios can be correlated with changes in survival rate
- Provide a means of easily monitoring the ratios going forward
- Provide a means of monitoring blood component wastage
