# Major Haemorrhage Protocol

Major haemorrhage is defined as blood loss requiring ≥4 units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) in the past hour, or blood loss with an anticipated need for ≥4 units RBC in the next hour. During treatment of major haemorrahge, 3 main blood componenets need to be administered: RBC, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Platelets. The majority of evidence from clinical literature indicates that transfusion of these 3 blood components specifically in a 1:1:1 ratio maximizes survival outcomes for patients.
